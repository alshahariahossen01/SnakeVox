### 3. **Check Voice Status**
Look at the **top-right corner** of the game window:
- **🟢 Green dot + "Listening..."** = Voice is working!
- **⚪ Gray dot** = Voice not active

### 4. **Give Voice Commands**
Say these commands clearly:
- **"UP"** - Move up
- **"DOWN"** - Move down
- **"LEFT"** - Move left
- **"RIGHT"** - Move right
- **"RESTART"** - Restart after game over

## 🔍 **Check Console Output**

The console should show:
```
VoskVoiceController: Loading model from: D:\Site\Voice-Controlled Snake\SnakeVoiceGame\vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15
VoskVoiceController: Successfully initialized! Say UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or RESTART.
VoskVoiceController: Now listening for commands...
```

When you speak:
```
VoskVoiceController: Heard: 'up'
VoskVoiceController: Command accepted: up
GamePanel: Applying voice command: up
```

## 🎯 **Tips for Best Results:**

### 🎤 **Microphone:**
- Use a **good quality microphone**
- Reduce **background noise**
- Speak **clearly and at normal volume**
- Position microphone **close to your mouth**

### 🗣️ **Speaking:**
- Say commands **clearly**: "UP" not "go up" or "move up"
- Wait a moment between commands (300ms cooldown)
- Speak at **normal pace** - not too fast or slow

### 🎮 **Gameplay:**
- Voice has slight delay (~200-500ms)
- Keyboard is still faster for competitive play
- Use **P** key to pause (works in both modes)
- Voice works better in quiet environments

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting:**

### **"Model not found" Error:**
✅ **Fixed!** Model is at: `D:\Site\Voice-Controlled Snake\SnakeVoiceGame\vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15`

### **No Green Dot / Gray Indicator:**
- Check console for errors
- Make sure you selected **Voice mode** in settings
- Verify microphone is connected
- Check Windows microphone permissions

### **Commands Not Recognized:**
- Check console - is it hearing you? Look for "Heard: ..."
- Speak louder/clearer
- Reduce background noise
- Try saying just the word: "UP" not "go up"

### **Microphone Permission Denied:**
Windows Settings → Privacy → Microphone → Allow desktop apps

### **Low Accuracy:**
- Vosk works best with clear speech
- Model is optimized for simple commands
- Background noise affects accuracy
- Consider using keyboard mode for precision
