# Voice-Controlled Snake Game - Improvements Summary

## üéâ Completed Enhancements

### 1. ‚úÖ Voice Control Fixes

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error logging with stack traces to help diagnose issues
- **Status Reporting**: Added real-time status messages ("Initializing...", "Listening...", "Ready", etc.)
- **Improved Responsiveness**: 
  - Reduced consecutive match requirement from 2 to 1 for faster response
  - Reduced cooldown time from 500ms to 300ms
  - Added detailed console logging to show what commands are being heard
- **Visual Status Indicator**: Added a green/gray indicator in the top-right corner showing if voice is listening
- **Better Initialization**: Clear console messages on successful voice initialization

**How to Use Voice Control**:
1. Go to Settings and select "üé§ Voice" control mode
2. Start the game
3. Look for the green listening indicator in the top-right corner
4. Say commands clearly: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT", or "RESTART"
5. Check the console for feedback on what commands are being detected

**Troubleshooting Voice Control**:
- Make sure your microphone is working and enabled
- Check that CMU Sphinx libraries are properly installed (via Maven)
- Look at console output for error messages
- Ensure you have microphone permissions for Java applications
- Speak clearly and at a normal volume

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Voice Control Not Working?
1. **Check console output** - errors will be printed there
2. **Verify microphone permissions** - ensure Java can access your microphone
3. **Test microphone** - make sure it's working in other applications
4. **Install dependencies** - run `mvn clean install` to download Sphinx libraries
5. **Check grammar file** - ensure `commands.gram` is in `src/main/resources/grammars/`

### Performance Issues?
- Try reducing game speed in game modes
- Close other applications using microphone
- Use keyboard mode if voice is slow
