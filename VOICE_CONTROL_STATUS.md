# Voice Control Status - Important Information

## ❌ **Voice Control is Not Available**

### Why Voice Control Doesn't Work:

**CMU Sphinx4 has been deprecated and removed** from all Maven repositories:
- The library is no longer maintained
- All versions have been removed from Sonatype snapshots
- No official JARs are available for download
- The project was abandoned several years ago

We tried:
1. ✅ Original snapshot repository - **Not available**
2. ✅ Maven Central repository - **Not available**
3. ✅ Alternative sourceforge versions - **Not available**
4. ✅ Official Sphinx4 documentation config - **Repository is empty**

### The Technical Reality:

```
ERROR: Could not find artifact edu.cmu.sphinx:sphinx4-core:jar:5prealpha-SNAPSHOT
```

This error means the libraries **no longer exist online**. This is not a configuration issue - the files have been permanently removed.

## 🔄 **Alternatives for Voice Control (Advanced):**

If you really want voice control, here are your options:

### **Option 1: Use Vosk (Modern Alternative)**
- **Vosk** is a modern, actively maintained speech recognition library
- Requires downloading a 50MB+ model file
- Would need to **rewrite VoiceController** class entirely
- More complex setup

**Steps:**
1. Download Vosk model from: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
2. Add Vosk dependency to pom.xml
3. Rewrite VoiceController.java to use Vosk API
4. Configure model path

### **Option 2: Use Web Speech API (Browser-Based)**
- Convert game to web-based (JavaScript)
- Use built-in browser speech recognition
- Would require complete rewrite in a different language

### **Option 3: Use Google Cloud Speech (Online)**
- Requires internet connection
- Requires Google Cloud account and API key
- Costs money after free tier
- Privacy concerns (sends audio to Google)

### **Option 4: Find Sphinx4 JARs Manually**
- Search GitHub archives for old Sphinx4 builds
- Manually download JAR files
- Add them to your project's `lib/` folder
- Configure pom.xml to use local JARs
- **Warning:** No guarantee of compatibility

- ✅ Fully working
